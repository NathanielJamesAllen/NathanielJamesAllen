### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I initally became interested in programming when by chance I took a computer science class as an elective during my senior year in highschool. Since then I have graduated college at Southern Virginia University and had a couple internship experiences along the way.
I'm currently on the lookout for front-end developer positions, but I am also open to full-stack or back-end positions. I would love to work at a company that emphasize learning and has a great work culture. If you're hiring, let's talk!
