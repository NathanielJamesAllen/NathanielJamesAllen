### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I initally became interested in programming when by chance I took a computer science class as an elective during my senior year in highschool. Since then I have graduated college at Southern Virginia University, completed a couple internships, and have gained valuable professional experience as a Systems Engineer.
I'm currently on the lookout for back-end developer positions, but I am also open to full-stack or front-end positions. I would love to work at a company that emphasize learning and has a great work culture. If you're hiring, let's talk!
